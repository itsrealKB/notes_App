## Features

## Technologies Used

The Notes App was built using the following technologies:

- React: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- nanoid: nanoid is a small, secure, and URL-friendly unique ID generator for JavaScript. It provides a way to generate random, unique, and compact IDs that can be used in various applications, such as generating unique keys, generating short URLs, and more. nanoid uses a cryptographically secure algorithm to generate IDs, ensuring that the generated IDs are unpredictable and virtually impossible to guess. The IDs generated by nanoid are also URL-friendly, meaning that they can be used in URLs without the need for encoding or decoding. nanoid is easy to use and has a minimal API, making it a popular choice for generating unique IDs in JavaScript applications.
- React-router-dom: a popular routing library for React applications that allows developers to define routes and handle navigation between them. It simplifies the process of creating client-side routing logic and enables developers to build single-page applications with multiple views and user-friendly URLs. The library is built on top of react-router and provides a set of routing components that are easy to use and highly customizable.
