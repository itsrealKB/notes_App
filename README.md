2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

To start the app, run `npm start` in the root directory of the project. This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To build the app for production, run `npm run build`. This will create a build directory containing optimized production-ready code.

## Features

The Notes App includes the following features:

- Create, read, update, and delete notes.
- Search notes by title.
- Sort notes by date created.

## Technologies Used

The Notes App was built using the following technologies:

- React: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- nanoid: nanoid is a small, secure, and URL-friendly unique ID generator for JavaScript. It provides a way to generate random, unique, and compact IDs that can be               used in various applications, such as generating unique keys, generating short URLs, and more. nanoid uses a cryptographically secure algorithm to generate             IDs, ensuring that the generated IDs are unpredictable and virtually impossible to guess. The IDs generated by nanoid are also URL-friendly, meaning that               they can be used in URLs without the need for encoding or decoding. nanoid is easy to use and has a minimal API, making it a popular choice for generating              unique IDs in JavaScript applications.

- React-router-dom: a popular routing library for React applications that allows developers to define routes and handle navigation between them. It simplifies the                         process of creating client-side routing logic and enables developers to build single-page applications with multiple views and user-friendly URLs.                     The library is built on top of react-router and provides a set of routing components that are easy to use and highly customizable.

- react-icons: React Icons is a popular library of customizable, SVG-based icon components for React applications.
